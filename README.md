* [tomchop.me](https://tomchop.me) - Personal website, let's see if I ever start writing something there...

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Core projects

* [Yeti platform](https://github.com/yeti-platform) - a lightweight Threat Intelligence platform. Ramping up the time I'm spending on this.
* [DFIQ](https://dfiq.org) - a repository of Digital Forensics Investigative Questions, bundled in a nice YAML format for consumption by automated tools.
* [Timesketch](https://github.com/google/timesketch/) - a forensics timeline analysis platform.
* [dfTimewolf](https://github.com/log2timeline/dftimewolf) - a digital forensics pipeline orchestrator. Think CyberChef for APIs! Actively maintained.

## ü™¥ Sporadic contributions

* [OpenRelik Volatility worker](https://github.com/tomchop/openrelik-worker-volatility) - A volatility3 worker for OpenRelik (openrelik.org)
* [OpenRelik Yara worker](https://github.com/tomchop/openrelik-worker-yara-scan) - A Yara scanner worker for OpenRelik (openrelik.org). Can feed off third party systems like Yeti.

## üì¶ Projects I've worked on in the past 

* [cloud-forensics-utils](https://github.com/google/cloud-forensics-utils) - Python library to interact with various cloud services and facilitate forensics-related actions (e.g. disk copying).
* [volatility-autoruns](https://github.com/tomchop/volatility-autoruns) - A plugin for the excellent memory analysis framework Volatility that enumerates auto-start extensibility points (i.e. "persistence") on a system.
* [FIR](https://github.com/certsocietegenerale/FIR) - Fast incident response - a lightweight incident response platform. Like a ticketing system, but for security incidents.
* [unxor](https://github.com/tomchop/unxor) - A fun experiment attacking weaknesses in XOR-based ciphers. Allows you to recover plaintext from any fixed-key XOR ciphertext, as long as you know a chunk of plaintext that is 2x as long as the key! (e.g. `This program cannot be run in DOS mode`)
* [malcom](https://github.com/tomchop/malcom) - Malcom - Malware Communications Analyzer - network traffic analysis and threat intelligence in the browser.
